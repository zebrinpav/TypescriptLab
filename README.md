# TypescriptLab
Objective
The goal of this lab is to experience the difference between untyped and strongly typed
languages. Typescript is a strongly typed language built on top of the weakly typed Javascript
language. Typescript compiles to Javascript, producing Javascript code that is not typed itself,
but has many of the advantages of strongly typed code as long as it is not edited after
compilation. Since Javascript is widely supported, Typescript can be used to produce better
quality Javascript code without needing to be concerned if Typescript is supported.
In this lab, you will be taking provided Javascript code and converting it to Typescript. You will
use the properties of strongly typed Typescript to fix errors in the Javascript code. You will
submit your Typescript code, which we will compile to Javascript and run unit tests to determine
if you have fixed all the issues.
We will be testing your code with the popular Javascript testing framework, Mocha in
conjunction with the assertion library, Chai. You will not need to understand the details of these
frameworks for the purposes of this lab. However, if you are interested in learning more, weâ€™ve
included documentation links below.
